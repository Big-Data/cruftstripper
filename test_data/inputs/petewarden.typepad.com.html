<p><a href="http://datasift.net/">DataSift</a> - UK startup focused on making it easy to build your own tools on top of massive social media streams like the Twitter firehose. Seems a bit like Yahoo Pipes for social data, without the visual interface, and could open up the area to a much wider audience of developers.</p>
<p><a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/30/the-doctor-vs-the-computer/">The Doctor vs the Computer</a> - A thousand-character limit on descriptions in medical records is so obviously arbitrary and unneeded, it hurts. Websites that have code to complain about spaces in credit-card numbers but somehow can&#39;t strip them out are bad enough, but here the bondage-and-discipline over-specification could kill people.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/01/trouble-in-the-house-of-google.html">Trouble in the House of Google</a> - Google&#39;s had massive success because they realized that inelegant statistical methods of detecting things like spam, plagiarism and relevance work a lot better than more elegant traditional semantic/AI techniques. Unfortunately, the black hats have figured out that there&#39;s no statistical technique in the world that can truly rate the quality of a page. Google&#39;s relying on statistical measures that used to correlate with that quality, but as the bad guys mimic those more closely, they are tricking the search engine into believing spam is the real thing. We need more inputs, whether that&#39;s a return of some kind of manual rating system, data from social networks or click-through rates.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.openheatmap.com/view.html?map=BaudsWholesUnwholesome">Bike Accidents in Tucson</a> - Exactly the sort of thing I built OpenHeatMap for. <a href="http://twitter.com/bikecolli">Collin Forbes</a> is using it to help influence the debate about policing in his city.</p>
<p><a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2011/01/this_isnt_a_pos.html">This isn&#39;t a post about Facebook</a> - Mourning the rise of a service that&#39;s a closed system, instead of the openness of Google. I&#39;m not as pessimistic as Paul, I think that Facebook is demonstrating how much people want tools that reflect their off-line social world and behaviors, and once the open world absorbs that lesson, we&#39;ll see a new wave of competition for the social network. That competition will have to be more open in a technical sense, just because that&#39;s such a tempting way to get early traction.</p>

<p>Maybe your purpose in life is to serve as an example to others of what <em>not</em> to do? That&#39;s a thought that actually cheers me up when I&#39;m feeling down, because at least it adds some meaning to horrible experiences. I was thinking about that when I read about <a href="http://one.valeski.org/2010/12/my-brush-with-personal-disaster.html" target="_self">Jud&#39;s brush with personal disaster</a>. Anyone<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=bppv+%22body+work%22" target="_self"> searching on BPPV</a>&#0160;now&#0160;has a detailed account of what went wrong and how he recovered. That may seem like a small thing, but for a handful of sufferers it will be information that helps them immensely. There&#39;s no theoretical limit on how long it could remain useful either - our great-great-grandkids could still be learning from his experiences.</p>
<p>We take economic growth for granted, but did you ever stop and think about what it actually means? Why should the same number of people be able to produce a few percent more for the same amount of effort, year after year, for centuries now? The secret is culture. As one person or organization discovers how to do more with less, that secret gets passed around and remembered collectively by humanity. Productivity is actually a massive series of niche lessons about what works and what doesn&#39;t. Our whole world is built on millenia of anecdotes like Jud&#39;s.</p>
<p>That&#39;s why the internet leaves me with so much hope for the future. Over my lifetime we&#39;ve created an incredibly powerful way of transmitting our experiences to others who care. Even if there&#39;s only a handful of people in the world who might benefit from a particular insight, for very little effort you have a good chance of reaching them and improving their lives.</p>
<p>People ask me if they should blog or <a href="http://twitter.com/petewarden" target="_self">Twitter</a>, and I tell them it won&#39;t make you money, it won&#39;t bring you fame, and in terms of the concrete returns, it&#39;s a waste of time. I still encourage them to do it though, because every true story is worth telling. For years despite low traffic I&#39;d keep going because the search logs would tell me there were one or two people a day who found a solution to their problem thanks to a post I&#39;d written. If you think about it, that&#39;s hundreds of people a year you can help, just by writing down a few of your experiences.</p>
<p>So, when you look at your life in 2011, ask yourself if you&#39;re leaving a trail of breadcrumbs? It might be the most effective way you can make the world a better place.</p>

<p>It&#39;s both easy and fun to be <a href="http://ronburk.blogspot.com/2010/08/cash-cow-disease-cognitive-decline-of.html" target="_self">a critic of Microsoft and Google&#39;s failed innovations</a>, but as so often in the tech world, Apple confounds most theories. Michael Dell <a href="http://news.cnet.com/2100-1001-203937.html" target="_self">advised Steve Jobs to close shop</a> in 1997, to avoid wasting more of the shareholder&#39;s money. Later, MP3 players looked like a classic loss of focus. The mistakes MS and Google made are only obvious with hindsight, and any simple rule you apply to weed out Kins or Waves would also kill the iPod.</p>
<p>Microsoft&#39;s track record on innovation is terrible, and Google&#39;s is starting to look troubled, so what&#39;s Apple doing differently? The key word from the original article is &#39;discipline&#39;. There&#39;s a legend that when Steve returned, he asked employees who ended up in an elevator with him &quot;What do you do for Apple?&quot;. Anyone who couldn&#39;t come up with something convincing by the end of the ride was fired. Whether or not that&#39;s true, it sums up the company culture.</p>
<p>Apple builds products that people pay for, at 30% margins. If your project can&#39;t meet those tough criteria, even as an idea, no resources are wasted on it. There&#39;s obviously cases like Safari that appear not to fit, but do you notice how the OS folks beg and borrow everything they can from the open-source world? That&#39;s because they&#39;re incredibly small teams of engineers, focused on supporting the money-making divisions.</p>
<p>Apple&#39;s different because everything it does is focused on making a near-term profit. Demanding money for products gives a flow of hard information about what&#39;s working, something other big tech firms have lost. They make mistakes just like any other company, but there&#39;s a tight feedback loop that catches them early, and lets them take baby steps to execute on big visions.</p>
<p>Both Microsoft and Google&#39;s big successes came after years of massive investments with little visible progress, so they seem relaxed about money-losing projects. That leaves them deaf to the grumbles of the market, unslapped by the invisible hand. They don&#39;t have to stay grounded in reality. Apple are rigorous about demanding money from their users, and so&#0160;they pay close attention to what people in the real world actually want. That&#39;s how you avoid catching cash cow disease.</p>

<p>I was recently having a discussion with <a href="http://twitter.com/pkedrosky/status/18512879678394368" target="_self">Paul Kedrosky</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/devahaz/status/18524067980124160" target="_self">Deva Hazarika</a> about weight, and it reminded me of my own aversion to scales. I have literally no idea what I weigh, I&#39;ve avoided them for over twenty years, and if I ever have to be weighed for a checkup, I don&#39;t look at what the result is. This is because numbers have power. If I start measuring my weight, then even small daily or weekly gains will make me anxious. The stress is counter-productive because it saps my morale and reduces my motivation to stay fit and eat well.</p>
<p>I&#39;m a particularly obsessive person when it comes to goals, which is why I&#39;ve learned to be careful what targets I use. Maybe other people find watching their weight helpful, but looking at the people I know well leaves me wondering if it works for anyone? If you think about it, nobody&#39;s end goal is to lose weight. What we actually want is to be healthier, fitter and sexier. There&#39;s better measures for all of those than raw mass, whether it&#39;s cholesterol levels, <a href="http://twitter.com/devahaz/status/18524239032221696" target="_self">running times</a> or just checking yourself in a mirror.</p>
<p>A quote I&#39;ll always remember from an undergraduate course is &quot;<em>You start off measuring what you value, and end up valuing what you measure</em>&quot;. Any time that we reduce a complex situation down to a single number, it distorts every action we take. We judge results by that metric, so anything it doesn&#39;t capture gets neglected.</p>
<p>My sister worked at a call center for years, where they were measured primarily on how many calls an hour they dealt with. She told me her colleagues would hang up on long-winded customers - apparently if you do it while you&#39;re talking, people assume it was a glitch. The numbers looked great, despite the harm it was doing the business.</p>
<p>If you watch the stock market prices every day, you&#39;ll sell low and buy high. The emotional response to seeing the numbers fall gets hard to resist, as does the greed when they&#39;ve been rising for weeks. What you actually care about is how much money you end up making, but the stock ticker doesn&#39;t capture that. It&#39;s why the average investor&#39;s returns <a href="http://www.behaviorgap.com/about-2/" target="_self">are so much lower than average investment returns</a>.</p>
<p>If you pay a programmer based on how many lines of code she produces, and you&#39;ll get incredibly verbose code with more room for bugs.</p>
<p>Is measuring your weight helping or hindering you from reaching your real goals?</p>

<p><strong>Dogs can shop</strong>. I was amazed to see people casually wandering the local Safeway (Church and Market) with pet dogs. According to a worker, they&#39;re forbidden by law from asking for proof that a dog is a service animal, and customers take full advantage. I&#39;m torn - as a dog lover thIs is incredibly convenient, but it seems like a really underhand way of achieving it. If I wasn&#39;t a canine fan, I&#39;d probably be aghast. I haven&#39;t taken Thor shopping yet, but I have been taking advantage of other places&#39; dog friendliness. <a href="http://www.shotwellsbar.com/" target="_self">Shotwell&#39;s beer bar</a> in the Mission not only welcomes them, the bar staff even give out treats, so my evening dog walks have a strange tendency to head in that direction.&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Clippercard is hard</strong>. I&#39;ve lost around $30 thanks to my inability to understand the nuances of the system. I swiped through the BART gate instead of the Muni one at Montgomery St, thought my card wasn&#39;t valid after I swiped and went into a negative balance on a Caltrain return trip so bought a paper ticket, swiped at a station before I realized there wasn&#39;t a train due in time and I&#39;d have to take a taxi, amongst other mistakes. I&#39;m starting to figure it all out now, but I&#39;m still confused by the apparent lack of a way to top up your card at a station. I was excited by the idea of doing it online, until I found out it might take three days for the money to appear on my card. Maybe the autopay system is what I need?</p>
<p><strong>I can parallel park</strong>. I never owned a car in the UK, and living in LA and Colorado I was spoilt by having a compact in a sea of parking lots, so I didn&#39;t have to learn how to squeeze my vehicle into a tiny curbside spot. That all changed here, I spent the last few weeks becoming a parallel parking ninja, and discovering the secrets of dealing with a car in the city. Almost all streets in my neighborhood are residential permit only over two hours, but there are a couple of back-streets that were open to all comers. Of course, you still have to move them weekly for street-cleaning, so it&#39;s hardly a painless solution. After spending the last month of navigating the system, I was very relieved to sell my car, it was such a source of stress, and the only way out looked like paying a few hundred bucks to rent a garage, which made no sense for something I rarely used.</p>
<p><strong>Big umbrellas are obnoxious</strong>. I didn&#39;t own an umbrella when I moved here, so as I was loading up with furniture at Ikea, I picked one up. Big mistake. You could have camped under it, and while it kept me perfectly dry, it was very embarrassing to jostle through the downtown crowds knocking lesser umbrellas out of the way. I found a nano-umbrella that folds down to pocket size, and now feel much less of a jerk.</p>
<p><strong>French food is good</strong>. I&#39;m a bit late to the party on this one, I know. I&#39;ve never gone out of my way to eat a French restaurants, the few I&#39;ve been to have been long on pretensions and short on execution, very forgettable. A couple of weeks back, an old Apple colleague and I got into a conversation with another diner at a local sushi bar, and it turned out he was a restauranteur himself. My companion is an impressive foodie, so she grilled him on his favorite places. He went into rhapsodies over <a href="http://www.ardoisesf.com/" target="_self">L&#39;Ardoise</a>, a traditional French bistro that&#39;s only a few blocks from my place. Intrigued, I tried it out and found myself in heaven. It&#39;s a tiny place, galley-style, the staff are entirely French, the atmosphere and service were very welcoming, the prices are reasonable, but most importantly, the food was a revelation. From light but rich soups, through salmon that melts under your fork, to coq au vin with a perfect sauce. Even their Creme Brulé isn&#39;t the stodgy pudding I remember, but a soft, creamy delight. I can&#39;t help myself, I keep going back. They have bar seating for when I&#39;m on my own, which gives you a great view of the chefs preparing the meals behind the hatch and I&#39;ve never needed a reservation.</p>
<p><strong>Those blue boxes are for mail</strong>. It&#39;s a small thing, but I&#39;d never lived anywhere without a mailbox in the front yard. For the first few days I left my outgoing mail in my apartment box, and couldn&#39;t figure out why they wouldn&#39;t take it. Finally I cornered our mail-lady, and she very patiently explained what those big blue boxes on most street corners are for.</p>

<p><a href="http://danariely.com/2010/12/15/locksmiths/">Locksmiths and perception of value</a> - If you don&#39;t understand what somebody&#39;s doing, then you judge them on how hard they make their job look. In software engineering I used to think of this as the acrobats vs gymnasts problem. Some programmers put on a massive performance to make the most pedestrian feats look as impressive as possible, like acrobats at the circus. Often the best engineers make the miraculous look easy, like Olympic gymnasts. If you&#39;re not careful as a manager, you&#39;ll reward the acrobats and neglect the gymnasts.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.beflix.com/">Glitch art</a> - I&#39;ve always found the random results of computer errors compelling and thought-provoking on a visual level, ever since I was old enough to wave a magnet near my CRT TV.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/gregg-easterbrook/2010/12/22/the-wonder-of-the-universe/">The wonder of the universe</a> - I failed to realize how much the estimate of the number of stars in the universe has grown in the last couple of decades. &quot;200 sextillion stars, a 2 followed by 23 zeroes&quot; is the latest, which has to be good news for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation">Drake&#39;s equation</a>, even if almost all of them are out-of-reach.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.diegovalle.net/2010/12/some-problems-with-mexican-mortality.html">Some problems with Mexican mortality</a> - Another great piece from Diego, showing that the victims of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acteal_massacre">Acteal Massacre</a> were listed as &#39;accidental deaths&#39; in the government statistics. A good reminder that we often accept numbers as hard facts, when you always need to know the rigor of the process that produced them to judge.</p>
<p><a href="https://edx.cde.state.co.us/growth_model/public/index.htm#/year-2010/district-0480/schools/focus-0919E,1136M,2552E,3940E">SchoolView</a> - The interface is a bit tricky to navigate at first, but once you&#39;re in this is actually a compelling visualization of schools&#39; quality across Colorado. Even more impressively, this is from the public sector, using <a href="https://edx.cde.state.co.us/">Oracle fusion</a>, according to a page I don&#39;t think they realize they&#39;re exposing.</p>

<p>Mad scientists of the world rejoice, <a href="http://twitter.com/edd" target="_self">Edd</a> and the other <a href="http://strataconf.com/strata2011" target="_self">Strata</a> folks liked the idea of <a href="http://petewarden.typepad.com/searchbrowser/2010/12/strata-rejects-lightning-talks.html" target="_self">a Rejects session</a> so much, it&#39;s now part of the official pre-conference program. It will now be starting at 6:15pm at the hotel, as one of the first sections of the <a href="http://bigdatacamp.org/sv" target="_self">BigDataCamp</a> unconference on the 31st, the day before the full show. The only downside is that we now have a hard time limit, so my original plan of running talks until the audience walked out has been scrapped. We still have some space left in the hour, and there&#39;s likely to be one or two slots open due to travel delays, but <a href="mailto:pete@petewarden.com" target="_self">email me now</a> if you want to avoid being rejected from the rejects! The whole <a href="http://twitter.com/bigdatacamp" target="_self">BigDataCamp</a> is going to be a lot of fun, so make sure <a href="http://bigdatacamp.org/sv" target="_self">you sign up for it</a>, and you&#39;ll also get <a href="https://en.oreilly.com/strata2011/public/regwith/str11dnaff" target="_self">a 25% discount on the main event</a>.</p>
<p>The wonderful data team at LinkedIn have even offered to help with liquid refreshments, so I know it&#39;s going to be a blast. Bring your lab coats, bubbling flasks and grudges against the uncomprehending world.</p>

				<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Sun_(Gotcha).png" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Gotcha" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83454428269e20147e0d91634970b" src="http://petewarden.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83454428269e20147e0d91634970b-800wi" title="Gotcha" /></a></p>
<p>Last night I ended up at Shotwell&#39;s with <a href="http://twitter.com/rwwmike" target="_self">Mike Melanson</a>, and we spent quite a lot of our time talking about journalism. He&#39;s a professionally-trained reporter with a masters degree, but the sheer pace of blogging at ReadWriteWeb means a lot of that education is not directly applicable. I&#39;m not saying his standards have lowered, but producing twenty articles a week requires a whole different approach to writing than a traditional US newspaper article.</p>
<p>The discussion reminded me of <a href="http://www.salon.com/books/stieg_larsson/index.html?story=/books/laura_miller/2010/12/14/docx" target="_self">an article defending Stieg Larsson&#39;s books</a> against <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/dec/12/genre-versus-literary-fiction-edward-docx" target="_self">the critics complaining that they&#39;re crowded out high literature</a>. Laura Miller makes the point that literary books are demanding to read, they require us to put in effort to understand unfamiliar ways of expressing ideas and emotions. That effort is rewarded by the revelations and sense of wonder you can only get from challenging works, but sometimes we don&#39;t have the energy left to tackle a tough read. Bad writing is often more enjoyable, because clichés, genre conventions and predictable plots all help a book &#39;flow&#39; more smoothly. They demand a lot less from the reader. That got me thinking about how I approach producing five or six posts a week.</p>
<p>American journalism is built on the assumption that reporters are providing a public service, and the top priority is communicating important truths to their readership. In turn, the readers are expected to be engaged and curious, willing to put in some effort to understand a complex story. This is a worthy goal, but leads to some painfully dry writing.</p>
<p>In contrast, the only value British newspapers hold sacred is entertainment. Even the serious newspapers go out of their way to avoid boring their readers, and the tabloids are full-blown three-ring circuses of populism, happy to publish blatant lies or fan prejudice in the pursuit of higher circulation numbers. I&#39;m sure that sounds like a nightmare to American reporters, but somehow it works, producing a better-informed readership than the US model.</p>
<p>That background leaves me very comfortable with the blogging approach to news. We still need traditional in-depth newspaper articles, but the popularity of blog-like news sites with off-the-cuff writing styles, liberal use of clichés and a willingness to publish before all the facts are in, shows that there was an unmet demand for digestible stories. I&#39;m not saying we should emulate the dark side of the British tabloids, but we need to understand that journalism is writing for a purpose, and it sometimes requires embracing the tools that bad writers rely on.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t expect the public to read you because what you&#39;re writing is important, just grab them by the throat by using every cheap trick at your disposal, from sensational, teaser headlines to hyperbole and synthesized conflict within the article. If the story is worth telling, you&#39;ll be doing more good than harm by reaching more readers.</p>

				<p><a href="http://petewarden.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83454428269e20148c6ddd32c970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Thorsraincoat" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83454428269e20148c6ddd32c970c image-full" src="http://petewarden.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83454428269e20148c6ddd32c970c-800wi" title="Thorsraincoat" /></a></p>
<p>My dog Thor hates getting wet, but even when there&#39;s rain lashing against the windows he still starts off dancing in circles when it&#39;s time for his walk. It&#39;s only when I pull out his yellow rain jacket that he slumps and stares at me mournfully. He seems convinced that if I just left the jacket off, the rain would go away.</p>
<p>Much as I try and convince him of the error in his logic, he&#39;s unmoved, and it&#39;s hard to blame him. Humans will happily swallow studies that use the weasel word &#39;link&#39; to claim something that is associated with an outcome is its cause. Does <a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/357/4/370" target="_self">obesity spread through your friendships</a>? No,<a href="http://cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/weblog/656.html" target="_self"> you just share the same risk-factors as your friends</a>.</p>
<p>As the Big Data revolution gives us more and more data to play with, we&#39;ll find many more suggestive correlations like these appearing. Our whole mental architecture is about seeing meaningful patterns, even if we&#39;re staring at random phenomena like clouds in the sky. How much these mirages matter depends on how we want to apply them -</p>
<p><strong>Prediction</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes you don&#39;t care about whether something causes an outcome, you just want some early warning of what that outcome will be. Thor knows it will be wet when he sees the raincoat. The main danger is that the two variables aren&#39;t actually dependent in any way, they just happen to have been moving in an apparently synchronized way recently. The more variables you have to compare the more likely these sort of false correlations are, so expect a lot of them with Big Data.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re going to rely on a correlation to predict outcomes, you need at least a plausible story for the mechanism behind the correlation, and ideally multiple independent data sets that back it up.</p>
<p><strong>Reaction</strong></p>
<p>If I notice I&#39;m struggling to get Thor out of the front door, then maybe I&#39;ll hide the rain jacket until we&#39;re in the porch. Thor&#39;s resistance means that he can no longer use the raincoat as a reliable signal of rain.&#0160;The only reason to make a prediction is to take some action, and those actions may destroy the correlation. This is a painfully common problem in economics, and is usually expressed as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart&#39;s_law" target="_self">Goodhart&#39;s Law</a>: &quot;<em>once a social or economic indicator or other surrogate measure is made a target for the purpose of conducting social or economic policy, then it will lose the information content that would qualify it to play such a role</em>&quot;.</p>
<p>This means that even if you&#39;ve found a correlation with predictive power, you have to constantly measure its effectiveness, since the very act of relying on it as a guide may degrade its usefulness.</p>
<p><strong>Control</strong></p>
<p>I half-expect to get up one morning and discover that Thor&#39;s eaten the raincoat, in the hope of bringing back the sun. Once we notice a correlation, it&#39;s easy to convince ourselves and others that it&#39;s actually causing the outcome. Humans love stories, and stories have their own rules. If X happens, followed by Y, narrative logic requires that X caused Y. That makes it simple to persuade other people that they&#39;re seeing cause and effect rather than correlation, without really having to prove it.</p>
<p>The only reliable way I know to figure out whether you really can affect outcomes is by experiment, so before you put time or money behind an attempt, require a prototype. If the guy or girl trying to persuade you to take action can&#39;t show a small-scale proof-of-concept, then they might as well be trying to sell you a bridge in Brooklyn. Even if they show compelling results, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect" target="_self">Hawthorne Effect</a> may be kicking in, but at least you&#39;ve got some weak proof.</p>
<p>If you want to be effective in a world awash with data, it pays to be skeptical of correlations, since you&#39;ll be seeing a lot more of them over the next few years.</p>

<p>At Apple, the engineers regularly organized &#39;brown bag lunches&#39;. These were informal midday presentations where one of the team stood up and taught everyone a subject or tool they&#39;re passionate about. I&#39;ve been missing that, so as an experiment I spent an hour at <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com" target="_self">Get Satisfaction&#39;s</a> offices today, giving their folks an introduction to MapReduce and Hadoop. I talked through when it&#39;s useful, and then we all got out our laptops and coded up a simple MapReduce job flow in Python, runnable from the command line and ready to be dropped into Hadoop.</p>
<p>I enjoyed it, and <a href="http://twitter.com/tempo/status/15163804518191105" target="_self">the team seemed to get a lot out of it too</a>, so I&#39;ve decided to do a few more. It&#39;s aimed at any company with Big Data problems and traditonal database expertise, and will leave your team with the ability to run simple Hadoop jobs on Amazon&#39;s Elastic MapReduce service, or just from the command-line, all using Python.</p>
<p>If this sounds like something you need, and you&#39;re in the Bay Area, <a href="mailto:pete@petewarden.com" target="_self">drop me an email</a>. The deal is that you feed me, give me schwag, and invite me to vacation on your yacht once you&#39;re rich and famous. I only have a couple of slots open before I fly off to Europe in the new year though, so do jump in quick.</p>

				<p><a href="http://pagerankgraph.com/#theatlantic.com" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Atlanticshot" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83454428269e20147e09f5597970b image-full" src="http://petewarden.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83454428269e20147e09f5597970b-800wi" title="Atlanticshot" /></a></p>
<p>I&#39;ve just launched <a href="http://pagerankgraph.com/" target="_self">PageRankGraph.com</a> - so what on earth is it?</p>
<p>A few days ago <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/2010/12/the-secrets-behind-blekkos-search-technology.php" target="_self">I sat down with the team at Blekko</a>, and as we were geeking out together I realized they&#39;d done something quite revolutionary with their search engine. They&#39;d made the information they use to calculate their rankings public. This may sound arcane, but for the last decade SEO experts have desperately tried to figure out what affects their position in search results, using almost no hard data. Blekko reveals a lot of the raw information that goes into these PageRank-like calculations, especially what sites are linking to any domain, how often and what the rank of each of those sites is. While the source data and algorithm they&#39;re using won&#39;t be identical to Google and the other search engines, it&#39;s close enough to at least draw some rough conclusions.</p>
<p>They provide their own view of this information if you pass in the <em><strong>/seo</strong></em> tag when you search, but I wanted something that told me more about where my Google Juice was coming from. For example, <a href="http://blekko.com/ws/http:%2F%2Fpetewarden.typepad.com%2F+/seo" target="_self">they list Twitter in top place for my site</a>, but I doubt it&#39;s helping my ranking very much, since Twitter&#39;s high rank will be heavily diluted by how many links it&#39;s shared between. Blekko don&#39;t offer an API yet, but they did seem relaxed about well-behaved scrapers, so I was able to pull down the HTML of their results pages and extract the information I need. The basic ranking formula is something like</p>
<p><em><strong>myRank = ((siteARank*#linksFromAToMe)/#linksFromAToEveryone)+((siteBRank*...</strong></em></p>
<p>I want to know who&#39;s making the biggest difference to my site, and Blekko gives me the <em><strong>siteARank</strong></em> and <em><strong>#linksFromAToMe</strong></em> variables I need. The only one that&#39;s missing is <em><strong>#linksFromAToEveryone</strong></em>, but they do show the total number of pages on each domain which works as a rough approximation of the number of links there. Pulling in that information for the top 25 sites they list then gives me enough data to calculate which of those are making the greatest contribution.</p>
<p>Just go to <a href="http://pagerankgraph.com/" target="_self">PageRankGraph.com</a>, enter the URL of the site you&#39;re interested in, wait a few seconds and you&#39;ll see a network graph showing the web of links that are contributing to that site&#39;s prominence in search results.</p>
<p>So, why is this interesting? Take a look at <a href="http://pagerankgraph.com/#theatlantic.com" target="_self">the graph for the Atlantic website above</a>. The Whitehouse website looks like it&#39;s making a significant contribution to the magazine&#39;s ranking in the search results. I&#39;m actually a long-time subscriber, but there&#39;s something a little odd about a news outlet&#39;s prominence on the internet being affected by the government. <a href="http://pagerankgraph.com/#foxnews.com" target="_self">FoxNews gets much less of a boost</a>, though intriguingly the EPA shows up as a contributor. Should all government sites use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nofollow" target="_self">rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;</a> for external URLs? Don&#39;t grab your pitchforks and march to Washington just yet, this data is only suggestive and Google may be doing things differently to Blekko in this case, but it&#39;s the sort of question that we couldn&#39;t get any good data on before now.</p>
<p>Just think of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/28/business/28borker.html" target="_self">the recent New York Times article on DecorMyEyes.com</a> - if they&#39;d been able to research where the links were actually coming from, they could have built a much more detailed picture of what was actually happening to drive the site up the rankings.</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zakwitnij/154691066/" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Invitation" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83454428269e20148c69671a2970c image-full" src="http://petewarden.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83454428269e20148c69671a2970c-800wi" title="Invitation" /></a><br /> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zakwitnij/154691066/"><em>Photo by Zaknitwij</em></a></p>
<p>Tonight I launched <a href="http://invitesdoneright.com/" target="_self">InvitesDoneRight</a>. Here&#39;s why.</p>
<p>Despite being pulled away from my original focus on email, I&#39;m still obsessed by how much valuable information is sitting neglected in our inboxes. Now that both Yahoo and Gmail support OAuth, I decided to release an application that&#39;s been on my mind for years.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re running a consumer web service, one of your most important distribution channels is your users sharing with their friends. Unfortunately there&#39;s never been an easy way to encourage this. Facebook might seem promising, but for good reason the service has made it hard for applications to broadcast indiscriminately to their user&#39;s social network. Many services use contact importing, but address books are both notoriously incomplete and full of people you met once at a trade show. Without extra information, you&#39;re stuck presenting the user with a space-shuttle control panel full of checkboxes, and asking them to wade through and figure out who to send invites to. If you get it wrong, not only are your invites ineffective but they&#39;ll be marked as spam by the recipients, making it very hard to reach even your existing users!</p>
<p>What&#39;s the answer? I think it&#39;s getting user&#39;s permission to scan message headers and pulling out a shortlist of people they actually exchange emails with. The user gets a nice experience, with only a few people to pick from. The web service gets a better-targeted set of recipients, which means higher conversions and fewer spam reports.</p>
<p>To implement this approach I&#39;ve just launched the <a href="http://invitesdoneright.com/" target="_self">InvitesDoneRight</a> service. If you have a website that signs up new users, just add an extra step that directs them to the service, I&#39;ll ask them for permission to figure out a shortlist of contacts, and then I&#39;ll call back a URL you provide with ten contacts that they&#39;ve been in touch with recently. It couldn&#39;t be much simpler to integrate.</p>
<p>What about privacy? I&#39;m still thinking hard about how this service could be abused, but I&#39;m rigorous in removing all user data the instant they leave my site. It acts purely as a middle-man between the external service and the mail provider, and only passes the short contact list back to that external service. No other information is either passed or stored or shared anywhere. No email content at all is fetched, just who the recipients are.</p>
<p>I think this could be a powerful tool for websites, as well as improving users&#39; experiences, but this launch is an experiment. Is it too creepy? Are there problems I&#39;m missing that will render it ineffective? Tell me what you think in the comments, or <a href="mailto:pete@petewarden.com" target="_self">email me</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2010/dec/07/twitter-applications-direct-messages-privacy" target="_self"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Tom Scott is shocked</span> [<em>Bad way of putting it, sorry, see the comments</em>] that OAuth granted permission to applications to read user&#39;s direct messages</a>. That&#39;s obvious to me as a developer. Everything else a non-private user does on the service is freely available through the search API and streams so there&#39;s no need to ask for permission. The important point is that Tom&#39;s confusion shows how little even sophisticated users understand Twitter&#39;s comparatively simple security model. What made my heart sink was his suggestion that Twitter go down the Facebook path and offer more fine-grained permissions.</p>
<p>If users don&#39;t have the time to understand the current model, does he really think they&#39;ll spend time tweaking a set of checkboxes? When Internet Explorer throws up dialogs complaining about a mix of secure and unsecure content on a page, does any user know what that means? The Facebook/Microsoft approach is a bunch of legalistic ass-covering by people keen to avoid blame, not a good way of getting informed consent from users.</p>
<p>Just look at <a href="http://overlawyered.com/2010/12/does-disclosure-matter/" target="_self">this exhaustive study of the effect of contract disclosures on internet user&#39;s habits</a>. Hardly anybody reads them, and the few who do don&#39;t change their behavior at all! The prevailing model of user security permissions hits exactly the same problem. We&#39;ve trained our users to click through screens of goobledegook without reading or caring.</p>
<p>So what&#39;s the answer? No checkboxes. No space-shuttle control panel of permissions. The only model that people understand is completely binary, public or private, open or closed. Look back to the phone book, everyone understood going ex-directory, and that&#39;s all you needed to know. In Twitter&#39;s case, this means redesigning the OAuth process so that it&#39;s just a &#39;give me access to your DMs&#39; dialog, since for almost all users that&#39;s what it really means. It&#39;s not a technology problem, it&#39;s a user-experience one.</p>

<p>I was pleased to see James Clark <a href="http://blog.jclark.com/2010/11/xml-vs-web_24.html" target="_self">admitting JSON has overtaken XML</a>, at least for the web world, and William Vambenepe <a href="http://stage.vambenepe.com/archives/1700" target="_self">pointing out that RPC over HTTP is giving True REST a good kicking</a>. They both imposed a lot of up-front demands on developers and promised a lot of automated benefits once the world caught up. Neither delivered.</p>
<p>They failed for web developers because they require planning and design to use effectively. Most of us barely have an idea of who our customers when we start a project, let alone a strong set of requirements. The strength of our world is that our systems are malleable enough that we can make it up as we go along. I spent most of my career in embedded systems and on the desktop, and it was an absolute delight to discover how simple it is to produce workable non-trivial applications on the web.</p>
<p>XML asks you to figure out a schema before you start. Proper REST APIs require providers to plan a set of URL locations and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2447677/rest-verbs-which-convention-is-correct" target="_self">verbs</a> to apply to those resources, and clients to figure out their conventions. Enthusiasts counter that you should be doing this sort of planning anyway to build a robust system, but that&#39;s a preference, not a law of nature. Doing a shoddy job quickly and learning from it often beats long development cycles.</p>
<p>Technologies like JSON, or APIs using HTTP for transport but with a domain-specific payload, fit into this chaotic development model. There&#39;s a similar dynamic with Hadoop, one of its biggest advantages is that you never have to pick a database schema, you just run jobs on the raw source files like logs or other data dumps.</p>
<p>The painful thing for any adult supervisor watching this sort of development is that they know how much technical debt is being accumulated. The reason it makes sense is that the debt almost never comes due. We re-write whole systems as the requirements change out from under us, projects fail (almost never for technical reasons) or we switch to a well-designed open source framework someone else has built. It&#39;s no free ride, you can see how hard it was for Twitter to retrofit their systems to cope with massive scaling, but the successful startups have been the ones able to move fast. We&#39;re in an era where punk rockers beat chamber orchestras.</p>

His experiences of dealing with government people ring very true, and I think he&#39;s absolutely right to advocate we all get more involved.
